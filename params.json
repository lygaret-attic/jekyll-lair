{"name":"Jekyll-lair","body":"# jekyll-lair\r\n\r\njekyll-lair is a template to use when you're starting out using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for a static website project. It's pretty opinionated, and may not be for everybody, but, seeing as how it provides almost no functionality of it's own, that's probably not a bad thing.\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nIt's about 30 minutes worth of work that you don't have to do.\r\n\r\njekyll-lair constists of a particular directory layout, a couple pre-included plugins (mostly from the list at the [jekyll project's wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins)), and a Rakefile to manage simple steps, like starting a preview server, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nImportantly, it's not a framework. It doesn't include base styles, a template switcher, any jquery plugins, yahoo widgets or google+ buttons. Where there are common pieces of markup that get used a lot (google analytics), they're included in the `_includes` directory, but not in the default layout.\r\n\r\nIf you want something to build your blog off of, see the [Octopress](http://octopress.org) project.\r\n\r\n### Opinions\r\n*All of these are really easy to change; they're included simply by plugins that are in by default and some Rake tasks.*\r\n\r\n* [**scss**](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets\r\n* [**coffeescript**](http://coffeescript.org/) for javascript\r\n* [**jasmine**](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) for BDD of javascript/coffeescript.\r\n* the default layout is from [**HTML5 Boilerplate**](http://html5boilerplate.com), and then cut way down. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThere's about seventeen steps I run through everytime I start out a new  project (usually static mockups). I'm tired of it. \r\n\r\nI use a standard markup base and a couple specific plugins in almost every project I run, so they're included here. A good number of them come from the various gists linked to in the [jekyll project's wiki page for plugins](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins). Credit is given where there's no explicit licence, and the license is included if there is. \r\n\r\n*If I'm using a plugin you wrote and you'd rather I not be, please, let me know so I can pull it.*\r\n\r\n### What about Octopress?\r\n\r\nThe *excellent* [Octopress](http://octopress.org) project is great for running a blog, and if that's your goal, I'd highly recommend looking at it before using jekyll-lair. It feels way too heavy for something that's not a blog though, and most of my static projects end up pulling more than half of what's there.\r\n\r\nPlus, where there's a will, there's a `git init`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. **Get the project into directory.**\r\n    \r\n    This isn't a project you clone. You can, if you'd like to contribute a fix for something (hint hint), but in general, this is a template you \r\n    You can download the [zipball](https://github.com/lygaret/jekyll-lair/zipball/master), or, from the commandline:\r\n\r\n        $ wget https://github.com/lygaret/jekyll-lair/tarball/master | tar -xz .\r\n\r\n2. **Install required libraries.**\r\n\r\n\t\t$ bundle install\r\n\t\t\r\n3. **Run the preview server.**\r\n\r\n\t\t$ rake preview\r\n\t\t\r\n4. ***Profit!***\r\n\r\n\tVisit [http://localhost:4500/](http://localhost:4500/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Standard Rakefile targets\r\n\r\n* `rake config`\r\n\r\n\tprints the current configuration from `_config.yml` and exits. Use this to see how your config file gets merged with the defaults.\r\n\r\n* `rake generate`\r\n\r\n\truns jekyll, with it's output going to `public`.\r\n\r\n* `rake preview`\r\n\r\n\tstarts jekyll, with the `auto` and `server`, making the site you're working on available at [http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292/).\r\n\t\r\n\tYou can configure the preview server using the `_config.yml` file. See the section marked off as \"Jekyll Preview Configuration\".\r\n\r\n* `rake archive`\r\n\r\n\tgenerates an archive of the `_public` directory of the site, placing it at public_archive.tgz. \r\n\t\r\n\tTo change the location where the archive is saved, or change the archive to be a zipfile rather than a tarball, change the `lair.archive` object in `_config.yml`.","tagline":"A base setup for a Jekyll-powered project","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
